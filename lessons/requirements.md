### Pre-requisites

If not already done, you should follow the below links to have your environment set up before starting the codelab:

* [How to Get Access to Project Firefly](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/overview/getting_access.md)
* [Setting up Your Environment](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/getting_started/setup.md)

### Codelab environment

Please note that, the alarms package mentioned in this lab is only available in Adobe I/O Runtime environment. In other words, you need to run and deploy your app with either of these commands: `aio app run` or `aio app deploy`. You will not be able to use it in the local standalone OpenWhisk deployment, which comes with `aio app run --local`.
